/**
 * @name EXECUTION_HEALTH
 * @description This evaluator is designed to run after a trading action has been executed.
 * Its primary purpose is to provide a post-trade analysis of the execution quality.
 * In a real-world scenario, this would involve checking things like:
 * - Order Fill Latency: How long did it take for the order to be filled after it was placed?
 * - Slippage: What was the difference between the expected price and the actual fill price?
 * - Rejection Rate: Are orders frequently being rejected by the exchange?
 * - Partial Fills: Are orders only being partially filled, indicating liquidity issues?
 *
 * The insights from this evaluator can be logged for human review or even stored in the
 * agent's memory to help it make smarter decisions in the future (e.g., avoiding illiquid
 * markets or adjusting order types during high volatility).
